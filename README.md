# Fablitic

App with a CLI to track PMS/PMDD symptoms.

# Why Fablitic

I needed to be able to track a bunch of symptoms each day over the course of my menstrual cycle for my doctor. While a simple chart on a clipboard works, I felt daunted by the number of questions facing me each day. Using a command line app allows me to answer the questions without feeling overwhelmed. It also allows me to not have to see the previous days answers.
